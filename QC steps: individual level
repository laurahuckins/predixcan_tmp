  Output of this should be either ten lists of individuals (one per CV set), or a "foldid" list, which gives the set for each individuals.
  
  EG:
  FID IID CV_Fold  
  ABCDE_1   ABCDE_1 1
  ABCDE_1   ABCDE_2 2
  ABCDE_1   ABCDE_3 4
  ABCDE_1   ABCDE_4 3
  ABCDE_1   ABCDE_5 7
  ABCDE_1   ABCDE_6 10
